Aidlearning is a Python programming framwork for mobile devices. In addition to some of the features available in the Linux environment, Aidlearning has supported GUI and neural network environments. For example, Caffe, Tensorflow, Mxnet, ncnn, Keras are perfectly supported.

Aidlearning是一个手机可用的Python编程框架。将Linux系统移植到手机上，开发者可以高效、方便地进行Python编程。除了一些Linux环境下可用的功能，Aidlearning还加入了GUI和神经网络环境，现阶段已经完美支持Caffe, Tensorflow, Mxnet, ncnn, Keras

### Graphical User Interface
### GUI集成

We fixed Graphical User Interface for the Linux on Andorid(It has been pruned by andorid!), so you can display results and debug quickly. For instance, You can use opencv to open and view camera!
